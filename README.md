DINING PHILOSOPHERS PROBLEM WITH TOKEN RING SOLUTION

Hello, I'm Burak. This project contains a token ring solution in Python for solving the Dining Philosophers Problem. The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classic synchronization problem that simulates a group of philosophers sitting around a table, thinking and eating. Each philosopher shares two forks with their neighbors, left and right.
